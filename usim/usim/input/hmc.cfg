// Configuration file
// Assumes a 3.2GHz processor with a single channel of 800 MHz DDR3 (1600 Mbps)
// All timing parameters must be in terms of DRAM clk cycles. Processor and DRAM clk should be in MHz
// Differences from ddr3-1600:  larger ROBSIZE, larger MAX_RETIRE, more CHANNELS, larger WQ, different ADDRESS_MAPPING to support high parallelism
